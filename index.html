            <p>We, as the creators of this tool, would like to emphasize that our intention behind its development is
                purely for educational purposes. The tool is designed to provide insights into IP addresses and device
                information, which can be helpful for learning and understanding networking concepts. However, we
                strongly condemn any illicit or malicious activities that may violate the law or infringe upon the
                privacy and security of others.</p>

            <p>We wish to make it explicitly clear that this tool should never be used for any form of cybercrime or
                unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or personal data. Any misuse of this tool is entirely
                against our principles, and we distance ourselves from any such activities.</p>

            <p>When using this tool, you, the user, must act responsibly and within the bounds of the law. Here are some
                key points to keep in mind:</p>

            <p><b>Legal Compliance:</b> Ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding internet
                usage and data privacy. Unauthorized access or intrusion into someone&apos;s computer system is illegal
                and can lead to severe consequences.</p>

            <p><b>Consent:</b> Always obtain explicit consent from the target person before attempting to gather any
                information about them. Using this tool without proper consent is a breach of privacy and is
                unacceptable.</p>

            <p><b>Ethical Use:</b> Utilize this tool solely for educational purposes, legitimate network analysis, or
                understanding how IP addresses and device information function in the context of networking.</p>

            <p><b>Non-Harmful Intent:</b> Refrain from using this tool with the intent to cause harm, defraud, or engage in any
                form of cyberbullying or harassment.</p>

            <p><b>Responsible Disclosure:</b> If you discover any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses while using this
                tool, we encourage you to report them responsibly to the affected parties or the tool&apos;s developers.
            </p>

            <p>By proceeding with the use of this tool, you acknowledge and accept the responsibility to act ethically
                and legally. The creators of this tool disclaim any liability for any misuse or inappropriate actions
                taken by users.</p>

            <p>Remember, responsible usage of technology promotes a safer and more secure digital environment for
                everyone. Let&apos;s contribute positively to the technological landscape and use our knowledge to
                empower and protect others.</p>
